Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nym Veach and I am an Environmental Scientist working in regulatory compliance for clean drinking water with the ND Dept of Environmental Quality.  In addition,  I am studying Earth Data Science at University of Colorado Boulder. I am passionate about all things water resources management - surface water, groundwater, stormwater, drinking water, water quality, water quantity, and more! I am excited to apply data analysis skills to solving complex environmental challenges facing us today, using innovative and creative interdisciplinary problem-solving along the way.

I have a professional background in environmental advocacy, organizing, policy, education, and field/lab research - bringing together a blended skillset with strengths in both communication and technical analysis. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Natural Resources Management from NDSU. Outside of work, I have three cats, enjoy a good cup of tea, quality nature time, and travel.

### Lake Metigoshe Map

Lake Metigoshe is an transboundary waterway near where I grew up, straddling the international border between North Dakota and Canada. It is a glacial lake with unique hydrological properties in the Turtle Mountain region. It has sensitive water chemistry and has struggled with nutrient pollution, leading to harmful algal blooms in recent years. As a part of Lake Metigoshe State Park, the lake supports important wildlife habitat and recreation activities. I spent a lot of time here in my youth and a summer in 2017 serving as a naturalist and environmental educator, which deepened my personal connection and professional curiosity of the landscape.
