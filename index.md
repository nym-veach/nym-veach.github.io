#### Professional & Educational Background
I'm an Environmental Scientist at the ND Dept of Environmental Quality. I oversee regulatory compliance data monitoring for safe drinking water in ND. I manage rules for disinfection byproducts, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and inorganic chemicals. 

I'm an Earth Data Science Student at CU Boulder! I am excited to apply data analysis skills to solving complex real-world environmental challenges facing us today, using innovative and creative interdisciplinary problem-solving.

Previously, I've worked in environmental policy, organizing, education, research, communications, and field/lab work. I graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.S. in Natural Resources Management with an emphasis in physical/earth resources science.

#### About Me
I've always had a deep curiosity and appreciation for the natural world. Growing up in rural North Dakota, I spent a lot of time outdoors. Outside of my professional work, I love spending time with my three cats, a good cup of tea, creative writing, reading, hiking, meditation, and traveling.

Lake Metigoshe is an transboundary waterway near where I grew up, on the international border between North Dakota and Canada. It is a glacial lake with unique hydrological properties in the Turtle Mountain region. It has sensitive water chemistry and has struggled with nutrient pollution, leading to harmful algal blooms in recent years. As a part of Lake Metigoshe State Park, the lake supports important wildlife habitat and recreation activities. I spent a lot of time here in my youth and a summer in 2017 serving as a naturalist and environmental educator, which deepened my personal connection and professional curiosity of the landscape.
