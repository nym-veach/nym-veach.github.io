#### Professional & Educational Background
I'm an Environmental Scientist at the ND Dept of Environmental Quality. I oversee regulatory compliance data monitoring for safe drinking water in ND. I manage rules for disinfection byproducts, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and inorganic chemicals. 

I'm an Earth Data Science Student at CU Boulder! I am excited to apply data analysis skills to solving complex real-world environmental challenges facing us today, using innovative and creative interdisciplinary problem-solving.

Previously, I've worked in environmental policy, organizing, education, research, communications, and field/lab work. I graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.S. in Natural Resources Management with an emphasis in physical/earth resources science.

#### About Me
I've always had a deep curiosity and appreciation for the natural world. Growing up in rural North Dakota, I spent a lot of time outdoors. Outside of my professional work, I love spending time with my three cats, a good cup of tea, creative writing, reading, hiking, meditation, and traveling.

### **Map of Lake Metigoshe created with Python**
Lake Metigoshe is an transboundary waterway near where I grew up, on the international border between North Dakota and Canada. It is a glacial lake with unique hydrological properties in the Turtle Mountain region. It has sensitive water chemistry and has struggled with nutrient pollution, leading to harmful algal blooms in recent years. As a part of Lake Metigoshe State Park, the lake supports important wildlife habitat and recreation activities. I spent a lot of time here in my youth and a summer in 2017 serving as a naturalist and environmental educator, which deepened my personal connection and professional curiosity of the landscape.

### Climate Change & Large Freshwater Lakes: Lake Superior’s Story Shows How Air Temperatures Alone Can Mislead

Lake Superior is the largest lake by surface area in the world, holding approximately 10% of the planet’s fresh surface water, and is among the fastest warming large lakes globally. At first glance, one might think the Lake Superior region isn’t being impacted by climate change, since near-shore air temperatures show a slight cooling trend (slope = –0.002 °C/year, R² = 0.02). This R² indicates that most of the temperature variation is natural and that the trend line explains very little of it.

This analysis highlights how air temperatures alone don’t tell the full story of climate change or explain complex air–land–water interactions. While local air temperatures appear stable or slightly cooling, broader regional and water temperature data reveal clear warming and climate change impacts such as increased precipitation, reduced ice cover, stronger storms, and changing habitats.

Large lakes like Lake Superior can modulate local air temperatures, acting as a thermal buffer by absorbing/storing heat, which can mask the full effects of climate change when examining air data alone.
