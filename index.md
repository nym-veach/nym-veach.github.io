Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nym Veach and I am an Environmental Scientist working in regulatory compliance for clean drinking water with the ND Dept of Environmental Quality.  In addition,  I am studying Earth Data Science at University of Colorado Boulder. I am passionate about all things water resources management - surface water, groundwater, stormwater, drinking water, water quality, water quantity, and more! I am excited to apply data analysis skills to solving complex environmental challenges facing us today, using innovative and creative interdisciplinary problem-solving along the way.

I have a professional background in environmental advocacy, organizing, policy, education, and field/lab research - bringing together a blended skillset with strengths in both communication and technical analysis. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Natural Resources Management from NDSU. Outside of work, I have three cats, enjoy a good cup of tea, quality nature time, and travel.
