#### Professional & Educational Background
I’m currently a student at CU Boulder in the Earth Data Analytics Graduate Certificate Program, developing skills in geospatial analysis, data analytics, and applying data-driven approaches to address the complex environmental challenges facing us today. My coursework involves processing and visualizing environmental data, using tools like Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and version control, and applying those technical skills to real-world projects. 

Previously, I worked as an Environmental Scientist at the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, overseeing regulatory compliance and data monitoring for safe drinking water, including disinfection byproducts, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and inorganic chemicals. Additionally, I worked with the Dakota Resource Council, a grassroots environmental nonprofit, supporting community engagement on sustainable natural resource and land-use issues. I have a deep passion for water resources, but am curious about all sorts of environmental systems.

My interdisciplinary background spans environmental compliance, stakeholder engagement, policy, education, communications, research, and field/lab work. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Natural Resources Management, with an emphasis in physical and earth resources science.

#### About Me
Outside of work, I love writing, reading, hiking, meditation, travel, and spending time with my three cats.

#### **Climate Change & Large Freshwater Lakes: Lake Superior’s Story Shows How Air Temperatures Alone Can Mislead**

Lake Superior is the largest lake by surface area in the world, holding approximately 10% of the planet’s fresh surface water, and is among the fastest warming large lakes globally. At first glance, one might think the Lake Superior region isn’t being impacted by climate change, since near-shore air temperatures show a slight cooling trend (slope = –0.002 °C/year, R² = 0.02). This R² indicates that most of the temperature variation is natural and that the trend line explains very little of it.

Grand Marais, MN station along the shoreline was used as a land-based proxy to get near-shore lake air temperatures. This analysis highlights how air temperatures alone don’t tell the full story of climate change or explain complex air–land–water interactions. While local air temperatures appear stable or slightly cooling, broader regional and water temperature data reveal clear warming and climate change impacts such as increased precipitation, reduced ice cover, stronger storms, and changing habitats.

Large lakes like Lake Superior can modulate local air temperatures, acting as a thermal buffer by absorbing/storing heat, which can mask the full effects of climate change when examining air data alone.

#### **Map of Lake Metigoshe created with Python**
Lake Metigoshe is an transboundary waterway near where I grew up, on the international border between North Dakota and Canada. It is a glacial lake with unique hydrological properties in the Turtle Mountain region. It has sensitive water chemistry and has struggled with nutrient pollution, leading to harmful algal blooms in recent years. As a part of Lake Metigoshe State Park, the lake supports important wildlife habitat and recreation activities. I spent a lot of time here in my youth and a summer in 2017 serving as a naturalist and environmental educator, which deepened my personal connection and professional curiosity of the landscape.
